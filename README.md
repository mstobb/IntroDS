# Introduction to Data Science
An introductory textbook on Data Science intended for a general audience. 

This text is a collection of notes and examples mostly taken from the *Introduction to Data Science* course at Coe College.  This course is focused on non-majors and assumes very little technical experience.  The necessary math and programming skills are introduced as they come up, with references to deeper documentation for the interested reader.  

This is a rough work in progress.
